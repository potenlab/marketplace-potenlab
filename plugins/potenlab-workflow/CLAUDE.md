# Potenlab Workflow — Plugin Rules

These rules are automatically applied when the potenlab-workflow plugin is active.

## Project Structure: Bulletproof React

All frontend code MUST follow this structure:

```
src/
├── app/              # Routes, providers, router
├── components/       # SHARED + STYLED components
│   ├── ui/           # shadcn components
│   ├── layouts/      # Page layouts
│   ├── common/       # Generic reusable (LoadingSpinner, ErrorBoundary)
│   └── {feature}/    # Feature-specific STYLED/PRESENTATIONAL components
├── config/           # Global config, env vars
├── features/         # BUSINESS LOGIC only
│   └── {name}/
│       ├── api/      # Supabase queries + React Query hooks
│       ├── components/ # BUSINESS-PURPOSE only (list, detail, create, edit, delete)
│       ├── hooks/    # Feature-specific hooks
│       ├── types/    # Feature types
│       └── utils/    # Feature utilities
├── hooks/            # Shared custom hooks
├── lib/              # Library wrappers (supabase client)
├── stores/           # Global state (Zustand)
├── types/            # Shared TypeScript types
└── utils/            # Shared utility functions
```

### Structure Rules

1. **features/{name}/components/** = Business-purpose components ONLY (list, detail, create, edit, delete)
2. **components/{feature}/** = Styled/presentational components (card, table, avatar, badge)
3. **components/ui/** = shadcn primitives, **components/common/** = generic reusables
4. **NEVER import across features** — compose at app level
5. **No barrel files** — import directly from source
6. **Unidirectional flow** — shared -> features -> app

## React Best Practices (Critical)

### Eliminating Waterfalls
- Use `Promise.all()` for independent async operations
- Place Suspense boundaries per data source, not per component
- Defer `await` until the value is actually needed
- Never chain sequential fetches that could run in parallel

### Bundle Size
- **No barrel file imports** — import directly from source files
- Use `next/dynamic` for heavy components not needed on initial render
- Defer non-critical third-party libraries (analytics, chat widgets)
- Configure `optimizePackageImports` in next.config.js

### Re-render Prevention
- Use `React.memo()` for components in lists or frequently re-rendering parents
- Derive state directly in render — never use useEffect to sync state
- Use functional `setState` when new state depends on previous state
- Use `useRef` for values that change but don't need re-renders

### Server Performance
- Use `React.cache()` to deduplicate identical server-side fetches
- Fetch data in parallel with `Promise.all()` in server components
- Use `after()` for non-blocking operations (logging, analytics)

---

## Supabase Postgres Best Practices (Critical)

### Schema Design
- Use `bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` or UUIDv7 for PKs (never serial, never random UUIDv4)
- Use `TIMESTAMPTZ` always (never `TIMESTAMP`)
- Use proper types: NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, JSONB — not TEXT for everything
- **Always index FK columns** — Postgres does NOT auto-index foreign keys

### RLS Policies
- Enable RLS on ALL user-data tables — no exceptions
- Use `auth.uid()` directly in policies
- Keep policies simple — use security definer functions for complex access
- Never use subqueries in policies (performance killer)

### Query Performance
- Select only needed columns (never `SELECT *`)
- Use cursor-based pagination (never OFFSET for large datasets)
- Create composite indexes for multi-column WHERE clauses
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to validate query plans

### Connection Management
- Use Supavisor connection pooling (Supabase built-in)
- Set `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '30s'`
- Set `statement_timeout = '10s'`
- Use transaction mode for short-lived queries
