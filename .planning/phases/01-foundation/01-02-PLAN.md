<objective>
Create the /pl:help and /pl:init skills that users invoke to discover commands and initialize projects.

Purpose: Enable team members to discover available commands and set up new projects with one command.
Output: Two working skills that register as /pl:help and /pl:init in Claude Code.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create help and init skills</name>
  <files>skills/help/SKILL.md, skills/init/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Create the `skills/` directory at plugin root (NOT inside .claude-plugin/) and add:

1. **skills/help/SKILL.md** with:
   - YAML frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     name: help
     description: Display all available Potenlab commands with descriptions
     disable-model-invocation: true
     ---
     ```
   - Content section titled "# Potenlab Help"
   - List of all /pl:* commands with descriptions:
     - `/pl:help` - Display this help message
     - `/pl:init` - Initialize project with MCPs, rules, and agents
   - Note about future commands coming in later phases

2. **skills/init/SKILL.md** with:
   - YAML frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     name: init
     description: Configure project with MCPs, rules, and agents in one command
     disable-model-invocation: true
     ---
     ```
   - Content section titled "# Project Initialization"
   - Instructions for Claude to:
     1. Check if .mcp.json exists, create if not with placeholder config
     2. Check if .claude/rules/ exists, create with placeholder rules
     3. Report what was configured
   - Note that this is a skeleton for Phase 1; full MCP/rules config comes in later phases

IMPORTANT:
- Skills directory MUST be at plugin root, not inside .claude-plugin/
- Use `disable-model-invocation: true` to prevent Claude from auto-triggering these commands
- Each skill folder contains exactly one SKILL.md file
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify structure:
- `test -d skills/help && echo "help dir exists"`
- `test -d skills/init && echo "init dir exists"`
- `test -f skills/help/SKILL.md && echo "help skill exists"`
- `test -f skills/init/SKILL.md && echo "init skill exists"`
- `grep -q "name: help" skills/help/SKILL.md && echo "help name correct"`
- `grep -q "name: init" skills/init/SKILL.md && echo "init name correct"`
- `grep -q "disable-model-invocation: true" skills/help/SKILL.md && echo "help has disable flag"`
- `grep -q "disable-model-invocation: true" skills/init/SKILL.md && echo "init has disable flag"`
  </verify>
  <done>
- skills/help/SKILL.md exists with correct frontmatter (name: help, disable-model-invocation: true)
- skills/init/SKILL.md exists with correct frontmatter (name: init, disable-model-invocation: true)
- Both skills at plugin root level (skills/ not inside .claude-plugin/)
  </done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete plugin with manifest, marketplace catalog, help skill, and init skill. The plugin should be installable and functional.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Test the plugin installation and commands:

1. **Validate plugin structure:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/deprasny/Documents/work/POTENLAB/marketplace-potenlab
   ls -la .claude-plugin/
   ls -la skills/
   cat .claude-plugin/plugin.json
   ```
   Expected: plugin.json with "name": "pl", skills/ directory with help/ and init/ subdirs

2. **Test plugin validation (if available):**
   ```bash
   claude plugin validate .
   ```
   Expected: No errors (or command not available in your version)

3. **Test in Claude Code:**
   - Open a Claude Code session in another project
   - Run: `/plugin install /Users/deprasny/Documents/work/POTENLAB/marketplace-potenlab`
   - Run: `/pl:help`
   Expected: Help output showing available /pl:* commands

4. **Verify namespace:**
   - Run `/help` in Claude Code
   Expected: /pl:help and /pl:init should appear in the command list

Note: If local install doesn't work, try the GitHub flow after pushing:
- Push to GitHub
- `claude plugin marketplace add potenlab/marketplace-potenlab`
- `claude plugin install pl@potenlab-marketplace`
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if plugin installs and /pl:help works, or describe issues encountered</resume-signal>
</task>

After tasks complete:

1. Directory structure matches:
   ```
   marketplace-potenlab/
   ├── .claude-plugin/
   │   ├── plugin.json
   │   └── marketplace.json
   ├── skills/
   │   ├── help/
   │   │   └── SKILL.md
   │   └── init/
   │       └── SKILL.md
   ├── README.md
   └── CHANGELOG.md
   ```

2. Plugin can be installed locally or via GitHub
3. /pl:help displays command list
4. /pl:init runs without errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Both skills exist with correct frontmatter
- Skills are at plugin root (not inside .claude-plugin/)
- Plugin installs successfully (local or GitHub)
- /pl:help displays available commands
- /pl:init runs and shows configuration steps
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
