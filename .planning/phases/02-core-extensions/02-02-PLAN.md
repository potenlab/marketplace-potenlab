  <name>Task 1: Update help skill with new commands</name>
  <files>
    skills/help/SKILL.md
    commands/help.md
  </files>
  <action>
Update skills/help/SKILL.md to include the new commands:

1. Update the "Available Commands" table to include:
   | Command | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | `/pl:help` | Display this help message showing all available commands |
   | `/pl:init` | Initialize project with MCPs, rules, and agents in one command |
   | `/pl:review <file>` | Analyze code and return structured feedback (read-only) |
   | `/pl:refactor <file>` | Refactor code with before/after explanation and test verification |

2. Update the "Coming Soon" section to remove items now implemented:
   - Keep: MCP configuration tools, Custom rules management, Agent templates, Project scaffolding
   - These are coming in Phase 3 and 4

3. Ensure command descriptions match the actual skill descriptions from 02-01-SUMMARY.md

Also update commands/help.md if it has any command-specific content that needs updating.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Grep for "/pl:review" in skills/help/SKILL.md returns match
    - Grep for "/pl:refactor" in skills/help/SKILL.md returns match
    - Help table shows 4 commands total
  </verify>
  <done>
    /pl:help displays all four available commands with accurate descriptions and argument hints.

  <name>Task 2: Verify plugin commands work</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Verify the plugin is properly configured by checking:

1. List all skills directories: ls skills/
   Expected: help/, init/, review/, refactor/

2. List all command files: ls commands/
   Expected: help.md, init.md, review.md, refactor.md

3. Verify each skill has proper frontmatter:
   - skills/review/SKILL.md has "allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob"
   - skills/refactor/SKILL.md has workflow with verification step
   - skills/help/SKILL.md lists all 4 commands

4. Verify plugin.json still valid (no changes needed but confirm)

Report the verification results.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - ls skills/ shows 4 directories
    - ls commands/ shows 4 files
    - Plugin structure is complete
  </verify>
  <done>
    Plugin has all Phase 2 commands properly configured and ready for use.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete:
1. skills/help/SKILL.md contains "/pl:review" and "/pl:refactor"
2. Command table shows 4 entries with proper descriptions
3. All skills have consistent structure
4. Plugin is ready for user testing

- Each command has description and argument hints where applicable
- Coming Soon section updated to reflect remaining work
- Plugin structure verified complete
</success_criteria>
