<objective>
Create the `/pl:research` skill that orchestrates parallel sub-agents to research a topic across multiple dimensions (technical, ecosystem, patterns, pitfalls, path forward) and synthesizes findings into a cohesive summary.

Purpose: Enable thorough research workflows that leverage Claude Code's parallel sub-agent capabilities for faster, more comprehensive topic investigation.

Output: `skills/research/SKILL.md` skill file with parallel orchestration instructions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create research skill with parallel sub-agent orchestration</name>
  <files>skills/research/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Create `skills/research/SKILL.md` with the following structure:

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: research
description: Research a topic using parallel sub-agents across multiple dimensions, synthesizing findings into actionable insights
disable-model-invocation: true
argument-hint: <topic>
---
```

**Key components to include:**
1. **Target section** - Parse $ARGUMENTS as the research topic
2. **Dimensions section** - Define 5 research dimensions:
   - Technical - What's technically possible? Constraints? Requirements?
   - Ecosystem - What tools/libraries exist? What's standard? Popular?
   - Patterns - How do experts approach this? Best practices? Architecture?
   - Pitfalls - Common mistakes? Gotchas? What to avoid?
   - Path Forward - Recommended approach? First steps? Priorities?

3. **Process section** with two phases:
   - Phase 1: Parallel Investigation - For each dimension, spawn a subagent to investigate, save findings to `.research/<dimension>.md`, return 2-3 sentence summary
   - Phase 2: Synthesis - Read all `.research/*.md` files, identify cross-dimensional themes, resolve contradictions, synthesize unified recommendations, clean up `.research/` directory

4. **Output Format section** - Define structured output:
   - Summary (2-3 sentences)
   - Key Findings table with Dimension, Finding, Confidence columns
   - Recommended Approach
   - Watch Out For (top 3 pitfalls)
   - Next Steps (checkbox action items)
   - Sources

Reference the code example in 03-RESEARCH.md for the exact implementation pattern.

Do NOT include `context: fork` or `allowed-tools` in frontmatter - let the skill use full tools for maximum flexibility.
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify the skill file:
1. `ls skills/research/SKILL.md` - file exists
2. Check frontmatter has correct fields: name, description, disable-model-invocation, argument-hint
3. Check content includes: dimensions, parallel subagent instructions, file-based synthesis, structured output format
  </verify>
  <done>
`skills/research/SKILL.md` exists with parallel sub-agent orchestration that defines 5 dimensions, instructs spawning parallel subagents with file-based output, and includes synthesis steps with structured summary format.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify research skill registration</name>
  <files>skills/research/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Verify the skill is properly structured for Claude Code plugin system:

1. Ensure the skill is in the correct location (`skills/research/SKILL.md`)
2. Verify frontmatter is valid YAML
3. Verify the skill follows the established pattern from review and refactor skills
4. Check that the output format matches the phase success criteria (synthesized summary, not raw logs)

If any issues found, fix them.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run these checks:
1. Frontmatter parses correctly (has name, description, argument-hint)
2. Instructions are clear and actionable
3. Output format section exists with structured template
  </verify>
  <done>
Research skill file passes all structural validation checks and follows the established skill pattern.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Phase verification for research skill:
1. File `skills/research/SKILL.md` exists
2. Skill defines 5 research dimensions
3. Skill instructs parallel subagent execution
4. Skill includes file-based synthesis pattern
5. Output format is structured (not raw exploration logs)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Research skill created at correct path
- Skill frontmatter has required fields
- Skill body defines parallel research workflow
- Output format produces synthesized summary, not verbose logs
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-advanced-extensions/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
