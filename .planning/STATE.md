## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Plugin name "pl" creates /pl: namespace (short, easy to type)
- Marketplace source "./" enables single-repo distribution
- Documentation at root for GitHub visibility
- Commands in commands/ for slash commands, skills/ for autonomous activation
- Project-scoped plugin installation preferred over user scope
- Review skill uses allowed-tools to enforce read-only mode (02-01)
- Refactor skill requires test verification before completion (02-01)
- Help command shows all 6 commands with argument hints (03-02)
- Research skill uses 5 fixed dimensions for comprehensive coverage (03-01)
- File-based synthesis via .research/ directory for subagent coordination (03-01)
- Slice skill follows 8-step Figma MCP workflow (03-02)
- No allowed-tools restriction on slice - needs full access for code generation (03-02)
